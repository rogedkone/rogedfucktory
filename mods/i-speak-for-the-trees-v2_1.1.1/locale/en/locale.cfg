i-speak-for-the-trees-v2=I Speak for the Trees Version 2

[mod-description]
i-speak-for-the-trees-v2=Trees, rocks, and a couple other things have a chance to spawn biters when a they are destroyed. It is fully customisable with all fetures being enabled or disabled independently. This mod is inspired by but not derived from https://mods.factorio.com/mod/i-speak-for-the-trees.\n\nWith this mod you can spawn a number of biters after a tree dies, a rock dies, a spawner dies, or after part of your base dies (the last is disabled by default). It will chose a biter or spitter apropreate for the current evolution to a max evolution (0.9 by default).
