This mod is inspired by but not derived from https://mods.factorio.com/mod/i-speak-for-the-trees \n\nWith this mod you can spawn a number of biters after a tree dies, a rock dies, a spawner dies, or after part of your base dies (the last is disabled by default). It will chose a biter or spitter apropreate for the current evolution to a max evolution (0.9 by default).",
